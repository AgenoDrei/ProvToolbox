- mvn clean install
  performs round trip testing

- currently fails on src/test/samples/activity.xml
	<pc1:foo>hello</pc1:foo>


- any is dumped to database
   but is not read properly

- problematic code is in src/main/java/org/openprovenance/prov/sql/Essai.java

//            this.any = ItemUtils.wrap(this.any, this.anyItems, Essai.EssaiAnyItem.class);

  should be uncommented out (twice) but the code fails to compile.
