  Two ways of handling locations.

  <prov:lieu> in prov:essai. 
             Uses a LocationAdapter

  <pro:test2> in prov:activity
    has defined a TypedObject in schema,
        corrected by sed, so that it understand attribute xsi:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Next steps.

1. Revisit TypedObject.
     Mapping to sql looks good. 
     Issue as to why field is a string and not an object?

2. Modify prov-xml so that all locations used this.
   This implies modifying the interface HasLocation

3. Make prov-sql work with this.
